# React Inshorts Clone

This a clone of famous short news website inshorts.com built in ReactJS.




## Important Note

For some reason, News API only works on mozilla browsers in free plan other than that - News api doesn't allow you to fetch the api from a deployed site. You can fork this repo and run in your local server and add your apikey in config.js file in the root.
